This application allows customers to view all of our stock, asks which prouct and quantity they they desire, validates that the item and quantity 
are available and completes the transaction by updating the sql database, and then shames the customer into buying more.


## Tech Stack
Node.js
* inquirer
* MySql
* console.table
MySQL

### ToDo
- Better input validation

* The tuffest challenge with bamazon was incorporating and understanding how different parts of a tech stack work. Key to overcoming this obstacle was developing a good quick break - fix pattern. Remembering to return to a known state, and approach any issues with small reproduceable tests.
